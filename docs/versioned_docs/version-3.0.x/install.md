The TypeScript version of RbxNet requires knowledge and usage of [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com).

## Install via Node Package Manager (NPM)  _(Recommended)_
RbxNet is available on NPM. To install it to your roblox-ts project, type the following in command line/terminal

```bash
npm install @rbxts/net@3.0.4
```
Once you have the module installed, you can then use it in code by importing it as such:
```ts
import Net from "@rbxts/net";
```
